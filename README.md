# Problem we solved
Everyday people have to travel to market to buy stuff for their household.  But now with Thela,people can easily order everything they want online.  It is better than Amazon and Flipkart because instead of online retailers we are collaborating with local stores in your city.  It is similar to Zomato but instead of just food items you can buy all the household's stuff from here.


# Problems we faced
We were newbies to coding and web development . We face hurdles in everything we did but somehow we pulled it off.


# Technology used
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
